The authors of the **DeepLesion** dataset recognize the importance and challenges of extracting, harvesting, and constructing large-scale annotated radiological image datasets. They propose a scalable approach that involves mining clinical annotations, specifically bookmarks in picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), made by radiologists during their daily workflow. This process results in the creation of DeepLesion, a dataset containing 32,735 lesions in 32,120 CT slices from 10,594 studies of 4,427 unique patients, covering various lesion types such as lung nodules, liver tumors, and enlarged lymph nodes. The authors emphasize the dataset's potential applications in medical image tasks and use it to train a universal lesion detector with a unified framework.
