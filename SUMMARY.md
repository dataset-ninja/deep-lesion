**DeepLesion** is a dataset for object detection, unsupervised learning, and weakly supervised learning tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 32118 images with 32733 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*lesion*).

Images in the DeepLesion dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (22494 images), *test* (4831 images), and *val* (4793 images). Additionally, every image contains information about ***age*** and ***gender***, while every object contains information about ***lesion diameter*** and ***lesion type***. The dataset was released in 2018 by the National Institutes of Health, USA.
